My personal answers to https://adventofcode.com/2020 (when found...)

## How to use
I copy-paste my input directly into `input.txt`. To read that input, every day starts with these lines:
``` python
with open('input.txt') as f:
    input_ = f.read().splitlines()
```
I code everything in a Jupyter Notebook. For readability reasons, you will find each day in a distinct `.py`. Each daily challenge is divided into two parts, so there are two answers to be given. If you run each file with the appropriate input, it prints both the answers.

In the following sections, I try to extract the core programming concept for each day, mostly based on how I solved it.

## Day 1

List/Array manipulation, combinations, basic loops, conditions

## Day 2

String manipulation, basic loops, conditions

## Day 3

List manipulation, string manipulation, modulo, basic loops, conditions

## Day 4

TODO
