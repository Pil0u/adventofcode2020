## How to use
I copy-paste my input directly into `input.txt`. To read that input, every day starts with these lines:
``` python
with open('input.txt') as f:
    input_ = f.read().splitlines()
```
I code everything in a Jupyter Notebook. For readability reasons, you will find each day in a distinct `.py`.
